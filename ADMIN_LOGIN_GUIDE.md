Admin Login Test and Troubleshooting Guide

If you're experiencing issues with the admin login not redirecting properly, 
try the following solutions:

1. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**
   - Clear all cookies for localhost:8000
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)

2. **Check Session Configuration**
   - The application uses session-based authentication
   - Make sure cookies are enabled in your browser

3. **Admin Credentials**
   - Username: admin@example.com
   - Password: admin123

4. **URL to Access Admin**
   - Direct URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
   - Login URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login

5. **Common Issues and Solutions**
   - If login succeeds but doesn't redirect: Clear cookies and try again
   - If you get "Invalid credentials": Check that the admin user exists
   - If page loads but shows login form: Session might not be working

6. **Testing Steps**
   1. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
   2. You should be redirected to the login page
   3. Enter credentials: admin@example.com / admin123
   4. Click Login
   5. You should be redirected to the admin dashboard

7. **Updated Features in SQLAdmin 0.21.0**
   - Improved session handling
   - Better redirect logic after login
   - Enhanced authentication backend

If issues persist, check the server logs for any error messages.
